                Magitech captures multiple layers of data during the gameplay, from summary statistics (e.g., level of gold achieved, types of business spells mastered) to learning and problem solving pattern (e.g., frequency of reviewing data and library, adaptiveness to in-game events) This exhaustive data captured is used to provide the Magitech score – a measure of the player’s business acumen in each of the core functional areas and critical thinking dimensions.
